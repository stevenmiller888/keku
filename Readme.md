## Installation

Make sure you have the [Khaos](https://github.com/segmentio/khaos) project scaffolder installed so you can easily build the template:

```bash
$ npm install -g khaos
```

Then install the template locally:

```bash
$ khaos install stevenmiller888/keku
```

## Usage

Create the app with the following command:

```bash
$ khaos create keku my-project
```

The app is organized into two folders, client and server. You can use ES6 syntax in
both. On the client, a Deku application boilerplate is provided with a flux-like
architecture. On the server, a Koa application boilerplate is provided with a few middleware.
